    <p>Hi <?= learner.firstName ?> <?= learner.lastName ?>,</p>
    <p>The provisional result for your <?= learner.settings.courseName ?> course is <b></b><?= learner.grade ?></b>.</p>
    <p>The official result from QQI will come via NCU Training and could take a month or two to be processed.
        Any queries relating to this or a letter of attendance should be directed to the offices of NCU.</p>

    <p>On behalf of myself and NCU, I would like to thank you for training with us and look forward 
        to further training.</p>

    <p>If you have enjoyed your experience and feel you have gained any new knowledge by attending the course 
        could I ask you to submit an email to info@ncultd.ie giving feedback. This may encourage others to join 
        in for training. NCU do not advertise and rely on feedback from people who attend the courses</p>
